<p>As mentioned previously, it's generally recommended to have at least a Medium plan for your multi-app projects. This size will give the project enough resources for all of your containers as well as the memory necessary to actually pull content from the Drupal container into Gatsby during its build. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that increasing the plan size applies only to the production environment of your project, and not to its development environments (which default to "Standard"). As you continue to work with Gatsby and a backend headless CMS, you may find that it is also desirable to upsize your development environments to match production (the "Environments application size" setting for your plan)</p>
