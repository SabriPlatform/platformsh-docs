Platform.sh allows you to maintain your code base in a third party repository and link it to your Platform.sh project.  The remote repository is the canonical, definitive copy of your application code and the Platform.sh project is just a read-only mirror.

Note that when a source integration is enabled, you should not push code directly to the Platform.sh repository.  It will get overwritten the next time the integration is triggered.
