    Review the basics of what makes up a Platform.sh project, including its three principle configuration files and how to define them for Gatsby.

{{< guides/config-desc name="Gatsby" >}}

## Requests configuration: `routes.yaml`

{{< guides/config-routes template="gatsby" name="Gatsby" >}}

## Service configuration: `services.yaml`

The `services.yaml` file lists the pre-packaged services you need for your application to run. You pick the major version of the service, and Platform.sh updates the patch version periodically so that you always get the newest version when you deploy.

Gatsby does not require services to deploy, so you can leave the `services.yaml` file empty for now. You can add [other services](/configuration/services/_index.md) if desired, such as [Solr](/configuration/services/solr.md) or [Elasticsearch](/configuration/services/elasticsearch.md). You will need to configure Gatsby to use those services as well once the service is enabled.

## Application container: `.platform.app.yaml`

{{< guides/config-app template="gatsby" >}}

In the template, `yarn` is run during the build hook to install all of Gatsby's dependencies, and then `yarn build` is run to build the site and output to the `public` subdirectory. If you would rather use `npm` to manage your dependencies, you can:

- delete `yarn` from the build hook
- update `yarn build` to `npm run build` in the build hook
- delete the `build.flavor` block, which tells Platform.sh to rely solely on the build hook to define the build process for your project when set to `none`. By default, Node.js containers run `npm install` prior to the build hook, so this block can be removed entirely from the configuration.
- delete the `dependencies` block, which includes `yarn`, since it is no longer needed. 

All traffic is then directed to the `public` subdirectory once the deployment has completed via the `web.locations` section.
